# NETWordTreeStringsFinder
Build a tree out of each word contained in a given dictionary and find any word in the dictionary contained in any text. 
I used it to find names and surnames out of bank statements, so there's more of it for this one like different dictionaries and specific match types for both names and surnames.

For dates it simply uses Regex.
